### Overview

This directory contains the starting point and the finished version of an Android app that can be built through the official [MediaPipe Handwritten Digit Classifier](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/mp-digit-classifier-android) codelab.

## Build the demo using Android Studio

### Prerequisites

*   The **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)**
    IDE. This sample has been tested on Android Studio Giraffe.

*   A physical Android device with a minimum OS version of SDK 24 (Android 7.0 -
    Nougat) with developer mode enabled. The process of enabling developer mode
    may vary by device. You may also use an emulator for this codelab.

### Building

*   Open Android Studio. From the Welcome screen, select Open an existing
    Android Studio project.

*   From the Open File or Project window that appears, navigate to and select
    the **start** directory if you are starting from the first step. If you
     want to view the completed app, select the **finish** directory. Click OK.
    You may be asked if you trust the project. Select Trust.
