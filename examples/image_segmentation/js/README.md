# MediaPipe Image Segmentation task for web

## Overview

This web sample segments objects in images and video frames. Objects are segmented in one of the provided images or from camera frames seen by your device's webcam.

It uses the [DeepLabV3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05587), an semantic image segmentation, where the goal is to assign semantic labels (e.g. person, dog, cat) to every pixel in the input image.

## Prerequisites

* A device that can access the web using Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
