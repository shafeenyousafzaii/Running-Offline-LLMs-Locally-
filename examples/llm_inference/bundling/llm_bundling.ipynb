It requires preparing the input text to align with the model's required format, running the model autoregressively, and sampling during each iteration. Consequently, once the user has converted their model into `tflite` format (comprising the model's graph and parameters), it becomes essential to augment it with additional metadata to ensure successful end-to-end execution of the model.\n","\n","Task bundler offers a practical approach to creating such bundles.
